This is the home for developing my suite of rainmeter skins that are meant to replace the vanilla
windows 10 desktop icons. Most of these skins are in beta state. The list of skins included are:

* clock(s)
* steam launcher (the beta edition of my `release on devianArt.com
  <https://www.deviantart.com/2bndy5/art/Goo-e-Steam-Launcher-664356170>`_)
* my computer
* music player
* recycling bin
* volume knob

All skins except "volume knob" are stable enough to test.
